# Loan-Repayment-Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a loan applicant will repay their loan or default based on historical data and various features related to the applicants. It employs machine learning techniques, particularly classification algorithms, to make predictions.

# Data:
The dataset used for this project contains information about past loan applicants, including features such as credit score, income, loan amount, employment status, and more. It also includes the target variable indicating whether the loan was repaid or defaulted.

# Approach:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare it for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Additional features may be derived or transformed to improve model performance, such as creating new features from existing ones or applying feature scaling or normalization.

Model Selection: Various classification algorithms are explored, including but not limited to Logistic Regression, Random Forest and  Decision Tree. Each algorithm's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using techniques such as cross-validation, F1 score which helps assess their generalization performance and identify potential issues like overfitting.

Model Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to make predictions on new loan applicants. The model's predictions can assist in decision-making processes for loan approval or risk assessment.
